    <p>With two decades of industry experience we have established an enviable reputation for delivering a high quality, reliable and professional contract packing, storage and distribution service. Our customers cover a wide range of sectors from food and beverage to personal care, beauty, homecare and retail. Each sector demands different contract packing requirements and from our first class facilities in Leicestershire we can provide a wide range of services from flow wrapping, shrink wrapping and cartoning to multi-bagging, manual rework and full service logistics. Our experienced team can also carry out collation packing, gift packing, point of sale display assembly, promotional and presentation packing to name but a few.
From one off projects to ongoing contracts and large volume FMCG products to delicate low volume runs, we work together to allow our customers to focus on their core business and do what they do best.
We offer a service which gives us a huge amount of flexibility and reduces our turnaround times significantly.</p>
